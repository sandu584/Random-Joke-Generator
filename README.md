# Random-Joke-Generator
Using fetch api i created a random joke generator. Whenever the user clicks the generate button, fetch api fetches a random joke from a random_joke api, and displays the joke on the screen.

I used html to structure the document, tailwind css to style the document and javascript for functionality.
To run this you just need browser and internet connection.
